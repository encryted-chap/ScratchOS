Scratch2CPU: The official documentation

Each sprite is treated as a Thread (or a fiber, if you want to get technical) in the operating system.
Every fiber is translated into a binary language that I call the scrasm instruction set.

0x0A, [integer] - Gets bytes (# of bytes specified by the number) and places them in a new thread. The thread is automatically queued for execution.
Does not require specifying the sprite to run on, this is always the parent thread's sprite.
0x0B, [sprite id] - switches which sprite the fiber manager should be executing on.
0x00 - nop, wastes a fiber instruction
0x01, [int], [int] - add two integer values and store result in accumulator
