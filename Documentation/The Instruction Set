Scratch2CPU: The official documentation

Each sprite is treated as a Thread (or a fiber, if you want to get technical) in the operating system.
Every fiber is translated into a binary language that I call the scrasm instruction set.

when flag clicked: defines the entry point for the fiber.
move(int): increments x by int 
turn left (int): increments direction by int
turn right (int): decrements direction by int
